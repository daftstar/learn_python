# Similar to the else, the elif statement is optional. 
# However, unlike else, for which there can be at most one statement, 
# there can be an arbitrary number of elif statements following an if.
# Core Python does not provide switch or case statements as in other languages, 
# but we can use if..elif...statements to simulate switch case as follows âˆ’
# elif continues to check other true values. 
# else is the false value command (optional)
